    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>2 ounces liver paté</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
      <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place beef tenderloin in a baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons softened
        butter over beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef
        from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and
        mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter together in a bowl;
        season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with
        onion and mushroom mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in
        the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick.
        Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of
        dough, and brush with egg yolk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F
        (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden
        brown, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        center should read between 122 to 130 degrees F (50 to 54 degrees C) for
        medium rare. Set aside to rest
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat.
        Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, about 5
        minutes. Strain and serve with beef.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
